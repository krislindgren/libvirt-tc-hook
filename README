This is a libvirt hook that will let you apply custom TC rules.

Currently it hooks into the vm start/vm stop events and applys rules defined on start of the vm and removes the rules on shutdown.

It Currently does:
   1.) Limit total bandwidth to 100mbit
   2.) Limit bandwidth for 'small packets' (mtu < 100) to 500kbit
   3.) Disable ipv6
   4.) Disable LMNR

TODO:
 1.) Create a master qdisk that polices all vm traffic to a % of the servers overall bandwidth
 2.) Parse the openstack flavor name from the libvirt xml and apply differnt policies

Install:

1.) Copy qemu-hook to /etc/libvirt/qemu/hook
(yes the name of the file changes from qemu-hook to hook)

2.) chmod 644 /etc/libvirt/qemu/hook

3.) Reload libvirt so that it will process the libvirt hook file:
systemctl reload libvirtd

Any vm's will have the TC rules applied to them on start.
You can backfill existing VM's via a script your own choosing.

This hook was developed by kurt payne (kpayne@godaddy.com) and Jim Gorz (jgorz@godaddy.com)
It was based on the hook found here: https://github.com/rhardouin/libvirt_hooks
